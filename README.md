## Introduction
It's debatable is an online debate platform where users can debate with their friends and family. They can have debate on existing debate topics or they can create their own debate topics. Users can also see their ongoing debates, ended debates, debates which are waiting to be started, etc.

Once both participants join the debate room, participant 1 can start the debate. Each participant will get 30 seconds to defend their side. Debates arguments can be translated in 5 different laguages namely Chinese, English, German, Greek, Spanish. 

If second participant joined as a guest user, they do not have any access to any feature of It's debatable except participanting on the debate they have invited to. However, they do have right to end the debate.

## Technologies
We used Javascript and Reach for frontend of It's debatable i.e. current git repository. We used Java in the backend of [It's debatable Server](https://github.com/sopra-fs22-group-19/Debatable_Server) repository. The other frameworks which we used in backend are Spring, Rest, Heroku (for deployment), SonarQube (code quality). We had weekly Scrums and the implementation period was divided into 2 sprints.

## High-level Components
## Launch & Deployment
## Illustrations




## Roadmap
Following are some features which would be nice additions:
### Debate viewers
It would be a nice addition to add viewers who can watch the debates.

### Debate Winner
Currently, there is no winner of the debates. Using the above feature and by upvoting and downvoting the arguments, debate winner can be decided.

### Debate Moderator
It would be nice if we can have a debate moderator who can try to keep the debating participants stick to the topic and can stop them from deviating.

### Live video mode of debating
In the current implementation, users type their arguments in the debate room. It would be nicer to have debates with people on live video mode.
