![logo](https://github.com/sopra-fs22-group-19/Debatable_Client/blob/master/src/images/logo2.png)
## Introduction
It's debatable is an online debate platform where users can debate with their friends and family. They can have debate on existing debate topics or they can create their own debate topics. Users can also see their ongoing debates, ended debates, debates which are waiting to be started, etc.

Once both participants join the debate room, participant 1 can start the debate. Each participant will get 30 seconds to defend their side. Debates arguments can be translated in 5 different laguages namely Chinese, English, German, Greek, Spanish. 

If second participant joined as a guest user, they do not have any access to any feature of It's debatable except participanting on the debate they have invited to. However, they do have right to end the debate.

## Technologies
We used Javascript, HTML, CSS, SCSS and React for frontend of It's debatable i.e. current git repository. We used Java in the backend of [It's debatable Server](https://github.com/sopra-fs22-group-19/Debatable_Server) repository. The other frameworks which we used in backend are Spring, Rest, Heroku (for deployment), SonarCloud (code quality). We had weekly Scrums and the implementation period was divided into 2 sprints.

## High-level Components
Following are the main components of It's Debatable Client repo:
1. [CreateDebate.js](https://github.com/sopra-fs22-group-19/Debatable_Client/blob/master/src/components/views/CreateDebate.js)

This file is reponsible for Create Debate page. You can enter a new debate topic, add tag, choose side, and description of a debate. It has create debate button, which will then direct users to debate room.

2. [MyDebates.js](https://github.com/sopra-fs22-group-19/Debatable_Client/blob/master/src/components/views/MyDebates.js)

This file is responsible for My Debates page. You can see awaited debates, started debates, ended debates, to be started debates. On clicking on any of the debate topics in each categories you will be redirected to debate room of that page where users can find the debates in the exact state they left.

3. [Topics.js](https://github.com/sopra-fs22-group-19/Debatable_Client/blob/master/src/components/views/Topics.js)

This file is responsible for Topics of debates which are either defaulted or created by the users in the past. Users can join a new debate by clicking on the side of the debates they wanna choose. They will be redirected to Debate Room.

4. [WsDebateRoom.js](https://github.com/sopra-fs22-group-19/Debatable_Client/blob/master/src/components/views/WsDebateRoom.js)

This file is responsible for Debate Rooms. We are using websockets for debate rooms. This is a most important file and uses [Chat.js](https://github.com/sopra-fs22-group-19/Debatable_Client/blob/master/src/components/ui/Chat.js) to conduct chats between participants.


## Launch & Deployment

To launch the client locally do the following, preinstall the following:

Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Other dependencies including React can be downloaded using:
```
npm install
```
After installing dependencies, just run the following to run the app locally:
```
npm run dev
```
Now you can open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

You can deploy app in production by creating an app on Heroku and deploying this repo using Heroku.

Current deployed version of the app is https://sopra-fs22-group19-client.herokuapp.com
## Illustrations
Users can either login or register to the platform. They will see a home page. Users can join the debates using exiting debate topis as shown in the image below:


![Topics](https://github.com/sopra-fs22-group-19/Debatable_Client/blob/master/src/images/topics.png)


Users can filter the debates by clicking the filter button above. They can then choose any filter. Debates will be filtered accordingly.

Users can also create a new debate topic using Create debate in the navigation bar.

Once users join the debate from topics, they will be redirected to debate room. Where they will see a invite button to invite second participant for the debate. They need to send the link to second participant. Second participant can join the debate by either login, register, or join as a guest. If user joins as guest, they don't have access to anything other than participating on that particular debate. Once second participant join, first participant can start the debate. Once the debate started, it will be chance of first participant to write their argument in 30 seconds time period. Participants can either post their answers by clicking enter button in their keyboard or clicking send button. If participant could not post their argument in 30 seconds, argument will posted automatically after 30 seconds. 


![debate_Started](https://github.com/sopra-fs22-group-19/Debatable_Client/blob/master/src/images/started_debate.png)

Both the participants can translate their or other participant's arguments in 5 different languages using translate button in the argument box. Both the participants can end the debate anytime using the end debate button.

## Roadmap
Following are some features which would be nice additions:
### Debate viewers
It would be a nice addition to add viewers who can watch the debates.

### Debate Winner
Currently, there is no winner of the debates. Using the above feature and by upvoting and downvoting the arguments, debate winner can be decided.

### Debate Moderator
It would be nice if we can have a debate moderator who can try to keep the debating participants stick to the topic and can stop them from deviating.

### Live video mode of debating
In the current implementation, users type their arguments in the debate room. It would be nicer to have debates with people on live video mode.
